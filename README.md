# Filterable Image Gallery

This project is a responsive and interactive filterable image gallery built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The gallery allows users to filter images based on categories such as "Logo Design", "Web Design", and "Mobile Design". Additionally, it features a spinner loader and a modal view to preview images in larger sizes.

## Features

- **Filterable Categories**: Users can filter images by selecting different categories from the navigation menu (e.g., Logo Design, Web Design, Mobile Design).
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Image Modal View**: Clicking on an image opens a modal with a zoom effect, displaying the image in larger view along with its caption.
- **Spinner Loader**: A spinner loader is displayed on page load to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, including responsive design and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity, including the filtering logic and modal functionality.
- **Bootstrap 4.5.2**: For layout and styling components like buttons and grid system.

## Project Structure

/index.html # Main HTML file /style.css # Custom CSS for styling /script.js # JavaScript for interactivity /img/ # Directory for storing images


## How It Works

1. **Filtering**: The user can click on any of the filter buttons (All, Logo Design, Web Design, Mobile Design) to display only the relevant images. The filtering logic is implemented in `script.js` using JavaScript’s event listeners and `classList` methods.
2. **Modal View**: Clicking on any image will open it in a modal view with a smooth zoom animation. This functionality is also handled by JavaScript.
3. **Responsive Layout**: The gallery layout uses Flexbox and CSS media queries to ensure the images are well-displayed across different screen sizes.
4. **Loading Spinner**: On page load, a spinner is shown and fades out after a short delay, enhancing the initial user experience.
